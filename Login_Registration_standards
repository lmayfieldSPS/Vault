# Class Files 

- Good practice to define each class in a separate file. Generally with the 
name containing class -
- Image.class.php
- User.class.php

-----------------------

- Before using a class, you MUST require it - 
example:
<?php
require('User.class.php');
$user = new User();

---------------

Autoloading Classes 
- It can be overwhelming to have too many require's. Autoloading solves it. 
When a script tries to use an undefined class, it throws an exception. We can solve this by
having php execute a function that runs before the execption, to load that class. 
Example:

spl_autoload_register('myAutoloader');

function myAutoloader($className)
{
  require($className. '.class.php');
}
