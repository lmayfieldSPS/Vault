============= Setting up a new Application ============
1) Go into the project folder / settings. 
2) Look for the list called "INSTALLED_APPS". Add the name of app folder. Example "first_app" -> Save
3) To verify -> python manage.py runserver -> if no errors, copy http://xxxx paste in browser. 
  Should receive page message "It worked"
4) CREATE A VIEW -> first_app -> views.py
